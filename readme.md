##Setup

You must first install NodeJS and NPM. These are system level so can be run from any directory.

1. Install Node http://nodejs.org/download/
2. Install Hombrew http://brew.sh/
3. `brew install node ruby`
4. `gem install sass`
5. `npm install -g gulp bower`

Once all of those have been installed, you can then install the local libs. cd to where you have this project cloned and run these commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `gulp build`
4. `gulp watch`

Then from then on in the future when working on the project you simply run `gulp watch`.
